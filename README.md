`mynmap` is a Bash script designed to streamline network scanning using `nmap`, a powerful tool for security analysis and penetration testing. This script offers various scanning options, including version detection, comprehensive scanning, vulnerability scripts, and evasion techniques to avoid detection.

## Features

- **Regex-based Input Validation**: Uses regex to determine if the user input is an IP address or a domain.
- **DNS Resolution via Tor**: Resolves domain names using `tor-resolve` for enhanced privacy.
- **Version Detection**: Identifies versions of services running on open ports.
- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Includes OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
- **Vulnerability Scripts**: Utilizes `nmap` scripts to identify known vulnerabilities.
- **Evasion Techniques**: Includes options to avoid detection by defense systems.
- **Full Port Scanning**: Checks all ports from 1 to 65535.
- **Proxychains Support**: Allows scans through proxies to conceal the origin.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MyCyb3r/mynmap.git && cd mynmap
   ```

2. **Make the install.sh executable**:

   mynmap
   ```

5. **For hints**:
   ```bash
   mynmap --help
   ```

## Scanning Options:

- **[1]** `nmap -sV`: Version detection.
- **[2]** `nmap -A`: Comprehensive scan.
- **[3-9]**: Scans with vulnerability scripts and evasion techniques.

## install.sh will install automatically:  

- **nmap**: will ensure `nmap` is installed on your system.
- **Proxychains**: Required for options using proxychains.
- **Tor**: Required for DNS resolution via Tor.
